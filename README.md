# Unit-1-2-Labs

This repository has the starter code and test cases for AP CS A Unit 1 and 2 Labs. 

**Prerequisites**
Make sure you have the following tools installed:
- Java (JDK 8 or later)
- Maven (used for running tests)

**Project Structure**
- For each lab, there will be a file with the starter code and a file with the test cases. For example, ManipulatingStrings.java contains the starter code and ManipulatingStringsTest.java has the test cases.
- Once you've implemented the appropriate methods, run the JUnit tests. They will help you confirm that your method implementations are correct.
